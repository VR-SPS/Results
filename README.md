### Privacy threats

- In our proposed VRLE (Virtual Reality Learning Application), vSocial, to simulate packet sniffing attacks, we captured a subset of packets being sent to/from our High Fidelity VRLE server IP address using Wireshark. Using the packet sniffing, we found that confidential information such user's avatar, host server information for VR rendering. etc. can disclosed compromising user privacy in VR environment. Explained results are represented below.
- This demonstrated that any packet containing confidential information about the user or application can be captured and deciphered. This becomes a serious risk compromising privacy, especially without a secured network protocol.
