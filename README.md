Privacy threats

- In our proposed VRLE (Virtual Reality Learning Application), vSocial, we captured packets having users' confidential information. Using the packet sniffing, we found that confidential information such user's avatar, host server information for VR rendering. etc. can disclosed compromising user privacy in VR environment. Explained results are represented below.
- Disclosure of such confidential information about the user or instructor avatar could allow attacker to affect the learning experience in VR environment by identity spoofing.
